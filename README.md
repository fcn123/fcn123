# This file is aimed to give some details about my code files: msbd5001-kaggle.ipynb and submission_new.csv
1.language: python

2.packeges: numpy, pandas, xgboost, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.matrix

3.steps to run the code:
  1) donwload the packeges we use in the code file
  2) add the directory: kaggle-run code in kaggle notebook or jupyter notebook to run the code file: msbd5001-kaggle.ipynb.
  3) maybe kaggle notebook is more convenient because it has contains the packeges we use.
  
4. the submission_new.csv is the final one I submitted in kaggle and it is also the better result during the many times I trained the model.Usually after 2 or 3 times, the Mse will become smaller.
