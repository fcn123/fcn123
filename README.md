# This file is aimed to give some details about my code files: msbd5001-kaggle.ipynb
1.language: python

2.packeges: numpy, pandas, xgboost, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.matrix

3.steps to run the code:
  1) donwload the packeges we use in the code file
  2) add the directory in kaggle notebook or jupyter notebook to run the code.
  3) maybe kaggle notebook is more convenient because it has contains the packeges we use.
  
4. the submission_new.csv is the final file I submitted in kaggle and it is also the better result during the many times I trained the model.Usually after 2 or 3 times, the Mse will be smaller.
